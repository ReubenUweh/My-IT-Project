## 🧠 PHP and MySQL Integration

### Database Structure (simplified)

- `users` (matric_no, name, password, role)
- `assignments` (id, student_id, course, file_path, comment, submitted_at)
- `feedback` (id, assignment_id, lecturer_name, category, message, rating, created_at)

### Server Logic

- Submit form sends data to `upload.php`
- Form data and file are saved in MySQL
- Lecturer feedback inserted via `feedback.php`
- `submissions.php` reads data from the database and displays per student
