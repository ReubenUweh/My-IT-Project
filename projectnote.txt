Copy
Edit
1. User selects course
2. User uploads file + comments

5.Animations
6.Respnsiveness

my js ideas:
🔹 1. Navbar Interaction:
Active link highlight: Change navbar item styling based on scroll position or clicked section.

Sticky behavior: Make the navbar shrink or change background on scroll.

🔹 2. Upload Page Enhancements:
File preview: Show selected file names or thumbnails before upload.

Drag-and-drop area: Highlight the box when dragging files over it.

Progress bar: Simulate or show upload progress (even fake progress for now).

🔹 3. Assignment Page
Accordion logic: Make accordion open/close smoothly with state toggling.

Dynamic search/filter: Let users filter assignments by name, date, or type.

Deadline countdown: Show remaining time for submission in real-time.

🔹 4. Feedback Page
Form validation: Check if fields are filled properly before submission.

Live word counter: Count characters in the feedback textarea.

Success modal or alert: Show a thank-you popup when feedback is submitted.

🔹 5. Homepage Animation Control
Scroll-triggered effects: Trigger animations as sections enter the viewport.

Typing animation: Show a typing effect for a heading or welcome message.

Dark/light mode toggle: Add a button to switch themes dynamically.

🔹 6. General Interactive Features
Local storage save: Save form data or theme preference so it’s remembered.

Popups or tooltips: Give users hints when they hover over icons/buttons.

Tab switching logic: If you add tabs later, use JS to manage content switching.

🔹 7. User Engagement Ideas
